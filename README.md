The program operates as follows:

Image Upload: Users can easily upload an image of a banknote through the system's intuitive web interface or the dedicated Android app.
Deep Learning Analysis: The system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically ResNet50, to meticulously analyze intricate features and patterns on the uploaded banknote image.
Authenticity Determination: Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted by the ResNet50 model, the system accurately determines the authenticity of the banknote. Real-time results are then provided, indicating whether the currency is genuine or counterfeit.
User-Friendly Interface: The system offers a user-friendly interface accessible through both the web and an Android app. This interface allows individuals and businesses to seamlessly verify the legitimacy of banknotes with ease and convenience.
